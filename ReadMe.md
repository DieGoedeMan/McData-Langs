# **McData - Languages**

These are the official language files for the McData Discord bot, which you can invite [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=792824373894840361&permissions=8&scope=bot). The changelog of the bot is has been moved to the [documentation](https://exstare.gitbook.io/mcdata/).`

## **🌐 Default languages**
The languages that are already supported are **English** and **Dutch**, simpely because I speak them. I would love to have a lot more languages, and so I provide the option to add a language or edit an existing one to make it better or fix issues!

## **👥 Contributers**
None at the moment.., you can be the first one! Read on for an explanation of how to do it.

## **⚙ Contributing**
You're able to make changes to an existing language and adding a new language.
> 📢 NOTE: If you dont know how to contribute on github, you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSjyU2vf6Y) tutorial.
