# **McData - Languages**

These are the official language files for the McData Discord bot, which you can invite [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=792824373894840361&permissions=8&scope=bot). The changelog of the bot is also included in this repo. This can be found in `Changelog.md`

## **🌐 Default languages**
The languages that are already supported are **English** and **Dutch**, simpely because I speak them. I would love to have a lot more languages, and so I provide the option to add a language or edit an existing one to make it better or fix issues!

## **👥 Contributers**
None at the moment.., you can be the first one! Read on for an explanation of how to do it.

You're able to make changes to an existing language and adding a new language.
